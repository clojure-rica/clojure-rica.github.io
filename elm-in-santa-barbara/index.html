      Though we spent most of our time inside on computers, we did get out to the water. Here we are on the Fisherman's Wharf of Santa Barbara, after renting out bikes. Ben is taking a photo with the iPhone 7 he bought on Monday.

      We tried changing the scenery but a local dog tipped us off that we were being watched by a drone, so we left.
